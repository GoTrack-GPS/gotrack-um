# Calibrate the sensor

<div id="calib">
</div>

Select a vehicle to perform calibration
  
  **1.** Make the tank empty
  
  **2.** Fuel input for 20 times, each time with 15 liters
     
- Each time, wait 1 minute for the sensor value to be sent back to the server or the sensor software (installed on the laptop).
  
**3.** After 20 fuel inputs we have a correction list
    
- And use this list to configure in the platform.
    The list is as follows:

    0L => y0

    15 L => y1

    30 L => y2

    ...

    300 L => y14
